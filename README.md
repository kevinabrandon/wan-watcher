# wan-watcher

A physical WAN health indicator for pfSense using an ESP32.

wan-watcher collects real-time WAN metrics from pfSense (latency, loss, jitter, and bandwidth usage) and exposes them to an ESP32, which drives LEDs and (eventually) a 7-segment display. The result is a small physical panel that shows your internet health at a glance.

---

## Features (current & planned)

* **pfSense metrics collector**

  * Polls dpinger sockets for latency / jitter / loss
  * Auto-maps each dpinger instance to its WAN interface
  * Calculates per-WAN bandwidth usage (Mbps)
  * Writes clean status/metrics files in `/var/run` for consumers
  * Supports multiple dpinger instances (e.g., WAN + WAN2)
  * Tracks per-WAN state and usage separately
  * Regularly posts to ESP32 each WAN's state

* **ESP32 indicator panel**
  * Receives state updates via REST-ish API (`POST /api/wan1/...`)
  * Web UI showing hostname, IP, last update time, and LED mapping
  * LED indicators for WAN state (UP / DEGRADED / DOWN) via MCP23017 I2C expander
  * Heartbeat LED showing how recent the last pfSense update was:
    * `< 45s`: OFF
    * `45–90s`: slow blink
    * `90–180s`: fast blink
    * `>= 3m`: solid ON + WAN forced DOWN
  * 7-segment display showing seconds since last update

## Hardware

* 1× Olimex ESP32-POE-ISO
* 1× MCP23017 I2C GPIO expander (address 0x20)
* 1× Adafruit 4-digit 7-segment display (HT16K33, address 0x71)
* Panel-mount LEDs for WAN status indicators

### I2C Wiring (Stemma QT / Qwiic)

| Signal | GPIO | Wire Color |
|--------|------|------------|
| SDA    | 13   | Blue       |
| SCL    | 16   | Yellow     |

### Pin Mapping

| Pin | Type | Function |
|-----|------|----------|
| MCP 0 | MCP23017 | WAN1 UP (green) |
| MCP 1 | MCP23017 | WAN1 DEGRADED (yellow) |
| MCP 2 | MCP23017 | WAN1 DOWN (red) |
| GPIO 4 | ESP32 | WiFi status LED |
| GPIO 5 | ESP32 | Heartbeat LED |

## Repository Structure

  esp32/         # ESP32 firmware (LEDs, 7-seg, API endpoints)

## ESP32 Wi-Fi Configuration

Inside `esp32/src/`, you will find:

```
wifi_config.h.example
```

Copy it to `wifi_config.h` and edit your SSID/password:

```
cp esp32/src/wifi_config.h.example esp32/src/wifi_config.h
```

`wifi_config.h` is intentionally **ignored by git** and should never be committed.

Each ESP32 assigns itself a unique hostname based on its MAC address:

```
wan-watcher-xxxxxx
```

The device also exposes itself via mDNS (Bonjour/Avahi):

```
http://wan-watcher-xxxxxx.local/
```

Your OS must support mDNS for this to work (macOS: built-in, Linux: Avahi, Windows: Bonjour).

## Installation (pfSense script)

1. Copy scripts under `pf/` to `/usr/local/bin`
```
/usr/local/bin/wan_watcher_poll.sh
/usr/local/bin/wan_watcher_post.sh
```
2. Make them executable:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wan_watcher_poll.sh
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wan_watcher_post.sh
```

3. Add two cron jobs per script (via pfSense Cron package):

```
* * * * * /usr/local/bin/wan_watcher_poll.sh 0
* * * * * /usr/local/bin/wan_watcher_poll.sh 30
* * * * * /usr/local/bin/wan_watcher_post.sh 15
* * * * * /usr/local/bin/wan_watcher_post.sh 45
```

The scripts updates WAN status, and posts to the esp32 every ~30 seconds.

## Status Files (generated by wan_watcher_poll.sh)

A status file is generated per wan at `/var/run/wan_watcher_wan*.status`
It is a tab separate file that looks something like this:

```
timestamp	state	loss_pct	lat_ms	std_ms	down_mbps	up_mbps
2025-12-01T00:42:30Z	up	0	6	0	2.0	3.3
```
